Pong arcade game recreated with Python Turtle — part of my 100 Days of Code

## 🎮 Controls
- Right Paddle: Up/Down arrows  
- Left Paddle: W/S keys
  
### ⚪ Ball Physics
- Bounces off walls  
- Detects paddle collisions  
- Resets to center when a point is scored  
- Dynamic rebound angle for smoother gameplay

### 📊 Score Tracking
- Live scoreboard  
- Updates automatically  
- Displays points for both players

### 🧱 Clean OOP Structure
The game is organized into separate classes:
- `Paddle` → paddle movement and boundaries  
- `Ball` → speed, direction, and bouncing  
- `Scoreboard` → updating and displaying score  

This kept the code clean, modular, and beginner-friendly.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Object-Oriented Programming principles  
- Using `turtle` to create animations  
- Collision detection  
- Real-time event listeners  
- Organizing multi-file Python projects  
- Writing readable and maintainable code

## 🚀 How to Run the Game

1. Clone the repo:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/bukolaomole415-blip/python-pong-game.git
Navigate into the folder:
cd python-pong-game
Run the game:
python main.py
Requires Python installed. The turtle module comes pre-installed with Python.

📦 Coming Soon
I’m preparing a downloadable .exe version so anyone can play the game without installing Python.
It will appear under the Releases section once ready.

💡 Part of My Learning Journey
This is one of several projects I've built during my Python 100 Days of Code course.
More projects coming soon!
